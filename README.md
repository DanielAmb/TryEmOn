# TryEmOn
The primary goal of TryEmOn is to create an interactive web application that allows users, including male and female, to visualize outfits before purchasing them online. By leveraging AI, the platform helps users feel more confident in their fashion choices. The need for this project arises from a common challenge: many online shoppers are hesitant to make clothing purchases without first seeing how the items would look on them. TryEmOn aims to solve this by offering virtual "try-ons" for outfits using avatars.

TryEmOn will be a Django-based web app that allows users to create personalized avatars and virtually try on clothing items scraped from online retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue and Depop. The system will use a TensorFlow-powered AI confidence rating to assess and provide feedback on how well outfits suit usersâ€™ body shapes and styles.
