# TryEmOn
The primary goal of TryEmOn is to create an interactive web application that provides personalized insights for users, regardless of gender, to help them make informed decisions about their outfits. By leveraging AI and color theory, the platform helps users feel more confident in their fashion choices. The need for this project arises from a common challenge: many individuals struggle to find outfits that complement their personal style, body shape, and color preferences. Often, people make fashion choices based on guesswork, which can result in unflattering combinations or a lack of confidence in their appearance.

TryEmOn is a Django-based web app that allows users to receive instant ratings and feedback on their outfits. The system uses a PyTorch-powered AI confidence rating and a color theory analysis to assess and provide feedback on how well the outfits suit the users and their styles.
